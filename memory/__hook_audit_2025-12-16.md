# Hook System Trust Audit Report

**Date**: 2025-12-16
**Tracking**: claude-bzm9

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical gaps found**: The hook system has significant misalignments between documented rules and mechanical enforcement. ~10 reducers may never trigger due to missing context population.

| Category | Findings |
|----------|----------|
| Hard Block gaps | 2 major |
| Dead reducers (context never set) | ~10 |
| Zombie state fields | 8 |
| Test coverage | BROKEN (import error) |

---

## Phase 1: Hard Block Enforcement Audit

### 🚨 GAP #1: Hard Block #2 - "No Blind Modifications" (PARTIAL)

**Rule**: "MUST read file before editing. MUST `ls` before creating."

**Reality**:
- ✅ "Read before edit" IS enforced via `gap_detector` hook (pre_tool_use_runner.py:1588)
- 🚨 "ls before creating" has NO enforcement mechanism

**Location**: pre_tool_use_runner.py:1587-1643
**Fix**: Add check in `gap_detector` for Write tool to verify parent directory was listed

---

### 🚨 GAP #2: Hard Block #3 - "No Fixed Claim"

**Rule**: Cannot claim task "fixed" without `verify` passing.

**Reality**:
- `fixed_claim` detection exists (stop_runner.py:1271)
- But it only applies **-8 penalty** via `StopHookResult.warn()`
- Does NOT block via `HookResult.deny()`
- Evidence check is weak: ANY file edit counts as "evidence"

**Location**: stop_runner.py:1271-1343
**Fix**: Change to blocking when confidence < threshold; require verification tool, not just file edit

---

## Phase 2: Reducer Context Gap Audit

### 🚨 GAP #3: Context Flags Never Set (~10 Dead Reducers)

These context flags are expected by reducers but **never populated**:

| Flag | Reducer | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `sequential_file_ops` | SequentialFileOpsReducer | DEAD |
| `git_spam` | GitSpamReducer | DEAD |
| `hook_blocked` | HookBlockReducer | DEAD |
| `huge_output_dump` | HugeOutputDumpReducer | DEAD |
| `incomplete_refactor` | IncompleteRefactorReducer | DEAD |
| `reread_unchanged` | RereadUnchangedReducer | DEAD |
| `trivial_question` | TrivialQuestionReducer | DEAD |
| `unbacked_verification` | UnbackedVerificationClaimReducer | DEAD |
| `fixed_without_chain` | FixedWithoutChainReducer | DEAD |
| `change_without_test` | ChangeWithoutTestReducer | DEAD |

**Root Cause**: Reducers check `context.get("flag")` but no hook sets these flags before `apply_reducers()`.

**Location**: lib/_confidence_reducers.py, hooks/_hooks_state.py:1162
**Fix**: Add context population hook at priority 5

---

## Phase 3: State Persistence Audit

### ⚠️ GAP #4: Zombie State Fields (8 fields)

Written but never read:
- `state.framework_error_turn`
- `state.last_active`
- `state.last_block_turn`
- `state.last_checkpoint_turn`
- `state.last_failure_turn`
- `state.last_message_tool_count`
- `state.ops_scripts`
- `state.serena_project`

**Impact**: Low - dead code/wasted memory

---

## Phase 4: Cooldown Bypass Audit

### ⚠️ GAP #5: Session Restart Bypass

- Cooldowns in `state.nudge_history` may not persist across sessions
- FP history DOES persist (`fp_history.jsonl`) ✅
- **Risk**: Bypass cooldowns by restarting session

---

## Phase 5: Test Coverage Audit

### 🚨 GAP #6: Tests Broken

```
ImportError while importing test module 'tests/test_confidence.py'
```

---

## Priority Fix List

| Pri | Gap | Fix |
|-----|-----|-----|
| P0 | Context flags never set | Add population hook |
| P1 | Hard Block #3 advisory-only | Upgrade to deny() |
| P1 | Tests broken | Fix imports |
| P2 | ls-before-create missing | Extend gap_detector |
| P3 | Cooldown persistence | Persist to file |
